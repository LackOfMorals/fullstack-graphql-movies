This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Uses Neo4j Aura for the backend with the Movies sample graph.  GraphQL for Aura is used to provide a GrapqhQL endpoint with the graphql type defs ( unchanged )  generated using introspection.

## Getting Started

First, install all required bits 

```bash
npm install
```


Modify /pages/_api.js for the settings to your GraphQL for Aura server .   Then save and start uup the server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.


## Deploy on Vercel
